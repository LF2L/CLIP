This program is intended to be a virtual space for sharing knowledge and experiences from the members of the Climate Lab consortium. The CLIP will serve as guidance and inspiration in the path of implementing the network of Climate Labs in Latin-American universities. The objective of this incubation program is to enable the Climate Lab Teams (CLT) to move forward in the design and implementation of their social innovation platform. Therefore, it is expected that all members of the CLT participate actively throughout the ensemble of the program. Welcome to the first version of CLIP and please enjoy the design of your Climate Lab https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/ https://www.pucpr.br/ "],["program-description.html", "Program Description Methodology Key Action Moments Successful completion of the program Operation and online platforms", " Program Description Methodology The CLIP has a duration of six months starting from April 9 until October 15. The incubation program is structured in six sprints in which participants are introduced to a set of conceptual material together with specific strategic workshops. Each sprint has specific goals that the CLT should fulfill in order to successfully complete the program. The results of each sprint are to be uploaded to the website assigned to each team. The website will serve as a prototype for the strategic design of the Climate Lab that the CLT can ultimately use to validate their proposals with other stakeholders, and as a dissemination tool for their local Climate Lab initiative. The incubation program is conceived as a collective pool of knowledge and therefore brings together various methods, practices and tools shared by consortium members and invited experts. All the different experiences are articulated under the innovation lab framework that has been developed by the ERPI of Université de Lorraine as part of its research strand in fostering collaborative innovation processes (Osorio et al. 2019). Building on the context analysis and capability mapping started in WP2.1., this incubation program proposes to the CLT to proactively and collectively strategize in terms of the main innovation lab components as shown in the figure below. Key Action Moments There are five key action moments throughout the CLIP: Sprint opening (1h30 per sprint) Synchronous webinar via Zoom in which sprint goals and main activities are presented to CLT Online material (Between 1h and 1h30 of video content per sprint) CLT can access the online material via the CLIP website. Content is composed by conceptual videos, case experiences and complimentary readings Members of CLT should access this content prior conducting each workshop Team workshops (Between 1h30 and 2h per workshop) Each sprint proposes to the CLT a strategic workshop that should be conducted as a team Workshops templates are provided via the Mural platform Tutorships (1h30 per sprint) Intermediary check-ins via Zoom are proposed to the CLT in the forms of Q&amp;A sessions This is the moment for CLT to exchange with their mentors and guest experts to share their experiences or ask questions regarding the ongoing sprints goal. Upload and share sprint results By the end of each sprint, the CLT should upload their workshop results to their Climate Lab website prototype At the beginning of the next sprint, the CLT will briefly present to the consortium their results and learnings Participants from each CLT are expected to dedicate 2 hours minimum per week to the CLIP. Successful completion of the program To successfully complete the incubation program, the CLT need to: Conduct as a team each one of the workshops that will be assigned in each sprint. Upload the workshop results to a non-published website that will constitute the prototype for the strategic design of their ClimateLab. Share progress at the beginning of each sprint. Final presentation of the strategic design of the Climate Lab at the mid-project meeting. Operation and online platforms All the incubation program content will be available through the CLIP Website: &lt;https://lf2l.fr/CLIP/&gt; Webinars and video calls will be held through Zoom. Workshop templates will be available via MURAL. Website prototype templates will be provided via Google Sites.

In addition, a series of contents and activities are proposed to the CLT to be completed during the course of the sprint: Firstly, you will find a summary video of the results from WP2.1. Secondly, three conceptual videos are proposed to open the discussion on the importance of defining a strategic intent for your Climate Lab and, further, to develop your own social design process as the methodological framework for your Climate Lab. Thirdly, two case experiences from members of the consortium are shared. This way we can learn a little more about the experience of each of our partners. Next, you will find the links to the two (2) team workshops of this sprint. The workshops should be completed before the end of the sprint (May 27). And finally, complementary readings are suggested for those who would like to further explore the topics addressed in this sprint. NOTICE! The full recording of the sprint 2 opening session can be watched below. 2.2 Conceptual Videos 2.2.1 Background on Strategic intent &amp; Process of Creation According to Moultrie et al. (2007), the design of an innovation environment enables the development of unique capabilities, allows the reconfiguration of existing capabilities to changing demands, and supports synergies between complementary assets. However, organizations rarely have explicit strategic goals underpinning the creation of their innovation lab initiatives. Instead, they often rely on single champions who are usually compelling sales persons whom believe passionately in the concept. Authors and practitioners agree that the existence of an underpinning strategic intent can prevent innovation labs or spaces to become vacuous spaces or merely innovation theaters with a superficial purpose. Some of the commonly aspects to consider at the moment of defining the strategic intent of an innovation lab are (Osorio et al. 2019; Moultrie et al. 2007): Strategic Intent - Guiding set of criteria for Innovation Labs Criteria Description Strategic &amp; Symbolic Goals To support the mission of the organization or association innovation strategy Ecosystem Approach To generate added value for all the stakeholders involved, to create long-term engagement and identification with the lab. Real Context World To capture or resemble real life environments (through space, equipment or methodologies). Users Involvement To involve users in the different phases of innovation cycle in which they can test, evaluate, contribute and co-create. Culture and Community To build an identity and to grow a community of users engaged and motivated with access to the laboratory. Teamwork To enhance teamwork in innovation, encouraging better communication (physical or virtual), encourage formal and informal social interaction and motivate staff. Lifespan To estimate the length of the project as a whole (short, mid or long-term). Beyond strategic reflection, it is also important to be aware of who will use the space and their needs, including the degree to which dedicated facilitation is required and ultimately, how the lab will be linked to the whole existing or desired innovation process (Magadley and Birdi 2009). Therefore, during the process of creationof an innovation lab one should be aware that, in practice, any work environment will evolve from the original intentions and will manifest the real work undertaken there. Here we share with you some of the commonly aspects to take into account during the process of creation of an innovation lab (Osorio et al. 2019; Moultrie et al. 2007): Process of Creation - Guiding set of criteria for Innovation Labs Criteria Description Intended Innovation Processes The intended role of the lab in supporting innovation processes: Opportunity Identification, Concept Creation, Concept Validation, Solution Development, Solution Deployment Intended Creative Activities The intended role of the lab in supporting creative activities: Search, synthesis, creation, prototyping or evaluation. Users and facilitators The intended users of the space: from occasional test users or students through to dedicated environments for co-located project teams. The degree of dedicated facilitation that the lab is intended to provide for the activities performed in/by the lab. Available resources &amp; constraints The availability of physical, financial, human and technical resources. Intended events The type of events that are expected to be held in the space, ranging from one-off meetings, marathons, conferences or project work 2.2.2 Summary of Results WP2.1 - Carola Calabuig Professor Carola Calabuig from the Universitat Politècnica de València presents the summary of the results of WP2.1 of the Climate Labs project. In this video she makes a review of the methodology used, a synthesis of the main results and finally some reflections and recommendations for the CLTs for the remainder of the project. 2.2.3 Defining the Strategic Intent of your Climate Lab - Ferney Osorio Struggling at building and sustaining a collective intent among stakeholders is one of the main challenges for teams in charge of leading an innovation lab. In this video, Ferney Osorio from Université de Lorraine and Universidad Nacional de Colombia explains the concept of strategic intent, why it should be the cornerstone for the design and implementation of an innovation lab initiative and how can be used in the case of the Climate Labs. The content of this video is based on (Osorio et al. 2019) and (Mantere and Sillince 2007). The Spanish version of this video can be accessed here. 2.2.4 Fab Living Lab: A collaborative innovation approach to support creative and sustainable territories - Laurent Dupont Laurent Dupont introduces the Lorraine Fab Living Lab® (LF2L) and how this platform supports collaborative innovation processes at the heart of the Université de Lorraine and the Grand Est Region in France. He develops the principles and motivations that led to the original conception of the Fab Living Lab approach, the framework on which the whole LF2L activity is orchestrated. To know more about this approach you can have a look to the paper (Dupont, Morel, and Pallot 2016). 2.2.5 Applying the Fab Living Lab approach in the renovation of the Museum-Aquarium of Nancy - Giovanny Arbelaez Giovanny Arbelaez from Université de Lorraine gives a detailed example of the application of the Fab Living Lab Approach. In this case, Giovanny navigates the process of redesigning the museum experience by integrating interactive technologies supported by the Lorraine Fab Living Lab. To know more about this project you can have a look to the paper (Ten, Arbelaez-Garces, and Dupont 2020).
