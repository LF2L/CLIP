This program is intended to be a virtual space for sharing knowledge and experiences from the members of the Climate Lab consortium. The CLIP will serve as guidance and inspiration in the path of implementing the network of Climate Labs in Latin-American universities. The objective of this incubation program is to enable the Climate Lab Teams (CLT) to move forward in the design and implementation of their social innovation platform. Therefore, it is expected that all members of the CLT participate actively throughout the ensemble of the program. Welcome to the first version of CLIP and please enjoy the design of your Climate Lab https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/ https://www.pucpr.br/ "],["program-description.html", "Program Description Methodology Key Action Moments Successful completion of the program Operation and online platforms", " Program Description Methodology The CLIP has a duration of six months starting from April 9 until October 15. The incubation program is structured in six sprints in which participants are introduced to a set of conceptual material together with specific strategic workshops. Each sprint has specific goals that the CLT should fulfill in order to successfully complete the program. The results of each sprint are to be uploaded to the website assigned to each team. The website will serve as a prototype for the strategic design of the Climate Lab that the CLT can ultimately use to validate their proposals with other stakeholders, and as a dissemination tool for their local Climate Lab initiative. The incubation program is conceived as a collective pool of knowledge and therefore brings together various methods, practices and tools shared by consortium members and invited experts. All the different experiences are articulated under the innovation lab framework that has been developed by the ERPI of Université de Lorraine as part of its research strand in fostering collaborative innovation processes (Osorio et al. 2019). Building on the context analysis and capability mapping started in WP2.1., this incubation program proposes to the CLT to proactively and collectively strategize in terms of the main innovation lab components as shown in the figure below. Key Action Moments There are five key action moments throughout the CLIP: Sprint opening (1h30 per sprint) Synchronous webinar via Zoom in which sprint goals and main activities are presented to CLT Online material (Between 1h and 1h30 of video content per sprint) CLT can access the online material via the CLIP website. Content is composed by conceptual videos, case experiences and complimentary readings Members of CLT should access this content prior conducting each workshop Team workshops (Between 1h30 and 2h per workshop) Each sprint proposes to the CLT a strategic workshop that should be conducted as a team Workshops templates are provided via the Mural platform Tutorships (1h30 per sprint) Intermediary check-ins via Zoom are proposed to the CLT in the forms of Q&amp;A sessions This is the moment for CLT to exchange with their mentors and guest experts to share their experiences or ask questions regarding the ongoing sprints goal. Upload and share sprint results By the end of each sprint, the CLT should upload their workshop results to their Climate Lab website prototype At the beginning of the next sprint, the CLT will briefly present to the consortium their results and learnings Participants from each CLT are expected to dedicate 2 hours minimum per week to the CLIP. Successful completion of the program To successfully complete the incubation program, the CLT need to:  Conduct as a team each one of the workshops that will be assigned in each sprint.  Upload the workshop results to a non-published website that will constitute the prototype for the strategic design of their ClimateLab. Share progress at the beginning of each sprint. Final presentation of the strategic design of the Climate Lab at the mid-project meeting. Operation and online platforms All the incubation program content will be available through the CLIP Website: &lt;https://lf2l.fr/CLIP/&gt;  Webinars and video calls will be held through Zoom. Workshop templates will be available via MURAL. Website prototype templates will be provided via Google Sites.

And finally, complementary readings are suggested for those who would like to further explore the topics addressed in this sprint. NOTICE! The full recording of the webinar can be watched below. 2.2 Conceptual Videos 2.2.1 Background on Strategic intent &amp; Process of Creation According to Moultrie et al. (2007), the design of an innovation environment enables the development of unique capabilities, allows the reconfiguration of existing capabilities to changing demands, and supports synergies between complementary assets. However, organizations rarely have explicit strategic goals underpinning the creation of their innovation lab initiatives. Instead, they often rely on single champions who are usually compelling sales persons whom believe passionately in the concept. Authors and practitioners agree that the existence of an underpinning strategic intent can prevent innovation labs or spaces to become vacuous spaces or merely innovation theaters with a superficial purpose. Some of the commonly aspects to consider at the moment of defining the strategic intent of an innovation lab are (Osorio et al. 2019; Moultrie et al. 2007) : Strategic Intent - Guiding set of criteria for Innovation Labs Criteria Description Strategic &amp; Symbolic Goals To support the mission of the organization or association innovation strategy Ecosystem Approach To generate added value for all the stakeholders involved, to create long-term engagement and identification with the lab. Real Context World To capture or resemble real life environments (through space, equipment or methodologies). Users Involvement To involve users in the different phases of innovation cycle in which they can test, evaluate, contribute and co-create. Culture and Community To build an identity and to grow a community of users engaged and motivated with access to the laboratory. Teamwork To enhance teamwork in innovation, encouraging better communication (physical or virtual), encourage formal and informal social interaction and motivate staff. Lifespan To estimate the length of the project as a whole (short, mid or long-term). Beyond strategic reflection, it is also important to be aware of who will use the space and their needs, including the degree to which dedicated facilitation is required and ultimately, how the lab will be linked to the whole existing or desired innovation process (Magadley and Birdi 2009). Therefore, during the process of creationof an innovation lab one should be aware that, in practice, any work environment will evolve from the original intentions and will manifest the real work undertaken there. Here we share with you some of the commonly aspects to take into account during the process of creation of an innovation lab (Osorio et al. 2019; Moultrie et al. 2007): Process of Creation - Guiding set of criteria for Innovation Labs Criteria Description Intended Innovation Processes The intended role of the lab in supporting innovation processes: Opportunity Identification, Concept Creation, Concept Validation, Solution Development, Solution Deployment Intended Creative Activities The intended role of the lab in supporting creative activities: Search, synthesis, creation, prototyping or evaluation. Users and facilitators The intended users of the space: from occasional test users or students through to dedicated environments for co-located project teams. The degree of dedicated facilitation that the lab is intended to provide for the activities performed in/by the lab. Available resources &amp; constraints The availability of physical, financial, human and technical resources. Intended events The type of events that are expected to be held in the space, ranging from one-off meetings, marathons, conferences or project work 2.2.2 Summary of Results WP2.1 - Carola Calabuig Professor Carola Calabuig from the Universitat Politècnica de València presents the summary of the results of WP2.1 of the Climate Labs project. In this video she makes a review of the methodology used, a synthesis of the main results and finally some reflections and recommendations for the CLTs for the remainder of the project. 2.2.3 Defining the Strategic Intent of your Climate Lab - Ferney Osorio Struggling at building and sustaining a collective intent among stakeholders is one of the main challenges for teams in charge of leading an innovation lab. In this video, Ferney Osorio from Université de Lorraine and Universidad Nacional de Colombia explains the concept of strategic intent, why it should be the cornerstone for the design and implementation of an innovation lab initiative and how can be used in the case of the Climate Labs. The content of this video is based on (Osorio et al. 2019) and (Mantere and Sillince 2007). The Spanish version of this video can be accessed here. 2.2.4 Fab Living Lab: A collaborative innovation approach to support creative and sustainable territories - Laurent Dupont Laurent Dupont introduces the Lorraine Fab Living Lab® (LF2L) and how this platform supports collaborative innovation processes at the heart of the Université de Lorraine and the Grand Est Region in France. He develops the principles and motivations that led to the original conception of the Fab Living Lab approach, the framework on which the whole LF2L activity is orchestrated. To know more about this approach you can have a look to the paper (Dupont, Morel, and Pallot 2016). 2.2.5 Applying the Fab Living Lab approach in the renovation of the Museum-Aquarium of Nancy - Giovanny Arbelaez Giovanny Arbelaez from Université de Lorraine gives a detailed example of the application of the Fab Living Lab Approach. In this case, Giovanny navigates the process of redesigning the museum experience by integrating interactive technologies supported by the Lorraine Fab Living Lab.

The full recording of the webinar can be watched below. 3.2 Conceptual Videos 3.2.1 Background on Physical Embodiment The materialization of an innovation lab itself encompasses all the characteristics of the physical (or virtual) environment. The design of the space varies significantly, with different design values and degrees of flexibility; also, the way the space evolves needs to be contemplated. Different innovation labs contain diverse levels of physical resources, from IT infrastructure, support of prototyping and visualization to the furniture. Each setup is realized based on specific constraints such as resources, space, skills and time (Osorio et al. 2019). In this sense, one should always think about the physical embodiment of an innovation lab in terms of its use, creation and intentions. This means that a lab that seeks to foster teamwork should probably prioritize flexible workspaces and social areas, while another that aims to generate radical ideas may emphasize playfulness along with the provision of multiple sources of inspiration (Moultrie et al. 2007; Klooker et al. 2018). The following are some of the aspects commonly considered to guide the physical embodiment of innovation labs (Osorio et al. 2019; Moultrie et al. 2007): Physical Embodiment - Guiding set of criteria for Innovation Labs Criteria Description Geographic Location The physical location of the environment and its relationship with the organization. This can include the organizations own in-house space up to external third-party facilities. Scale The physical scale of the environment. Real vs Virtual The degree to which the space is designed around virtual teamwork and communication. Flexibility The degree of flexibility of the space to enable alternative configurations and uses. The degree of flexibility/reconfigurability of resources in the workspace. Design Values Specific design values targeted at encouraging specific behaviors. The use of imagery to reinforce actions. IT Resources The role of IT to enable group work, activities and processes. Data &amp; Information The availability of local data/information to support innovation, creativity or design processes/activities. Prototyping &amp; Visualization Availability of equipment, facilities and tools to support modeling and visualization activities as a core component of creative and design processes. Constraints Practical constraints on the design of the environment Evolution The degree to which evolution is planned to meet future goals. 3.2.2 Why to develop a Technological Strategy for our Climate Labs? - Mauricio Camargo Professor Mauricio Camargo from Université de Lorraine explains the concept of Management of Technological Resources as a means to identify the critical assets, capabilities and infrastructure for the sustainability of the Climate Labs. This prospective approach is instrumental in rapidly changing environments with a great deal of uncertainty. To know more about this approach you can have a look to the paper (Boly, Camargo, and Marche 2018; Marche, Boly, and Camargo 2017). The Spanish version of this video can be accessed here. 3.2.3 Supporting Social Innovation across the world - Mark Anderson Mark Majewsky Anderson, Director of Research and Innovation at Glasgow Caledonian University presents his perspective on social innovation in the university context. He also shares his experience in promoting the implementation of social support units in universities across Latin America, Asia and Europe. 3.2.4 Implementing Innovation Spaces: The case of Hotmilk at PUCPR - Fernando Luciano &amp; André Turbay In this video, Professor Fernando Luciano, Director of HotMilk the Innovation Ecosystem at PUCPR, discusses the conditions, challenges and concepts underlying the decision-making that led to the HotMilk space. We present this experience as a way to contribute ideas and possibilities for the ClimateLabs structures. 3.3 Case Experiences 3.3.1 Ashoka Mexico  Gabriela Carrasco Gabriela Carrasco from Ashoka Mexico presents the experience of the Social Innovation Center at the Universidad de Aysén in the Chilean Patagonia. This is one of the more than 40 university initiatives that have participated in Ashoka Commons, a program to accelerate university projects in social innovation. 3.3.2 Instituto Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara  Sebastián Gradilla y Diego Díaz Professor Sebastián Gradilla and masters student Diego Díaz of the Instituto Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara explain the role of the Sustainability and Climate Change Laboratory in addressing the challenges of agro-industrial waste management in the Jalisco region of Mexico. 3.4 Team Workshop 4 Below you can find for each University the link to workshop for the Sprint III: Colombia Universidad de Caldas: Workshop 4 Universidad del Quindio: Workshop 4 Universidad de Manizales: Workshop 4 Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira: Workshop 4 Corporacion Universitaria Minuto de Dios: Workshop 4 Mexico Instituto Tecnológico y Estudios Superiores de Monterrey: Workshop 4 Universidad de Guadalajara: Workshop 4 Brazil Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul: Workshop 4 Pontifícia Universidade Católica Do Paraná: Workshop 4 Universidade Católica de Pernambuco: Workshop 4 3.5 Let us know your comments In this section, you can put any comments/questions or share your thoughts and feedback about this sprint.

The full recording of the webinar can be watched below. 4.2 Conceptual Videos 4.2.1 Background on Process of Use &amp; Outcomes Innovation labs are forced to adapt to the changing conditions and this may lead to new or adapted uses of the space. The way innovation is actually supported, which creative activities are done within the lab, or to what degree the space really enables teamwork are some of the elements to take into consideration. But more importantly is to be sensitive to compare how much this has changed in comparison to the original intent and the process of creation. Being flexible but tracking those changes could lead to helpful insights to understand the role the lab. The following are some of the aspects that should guide the process of use of an innovation lab (Osorio et al. 2019; Moultrie et al. 2007): Process of Use - Guiding set of criteria for Innovation Labs Criteria Description Supporting Innovation The stage(s) of the innovation process in which the lab is actually used Supporting Creativity The way in which the lab effectively supports creative activities Actual users &amp; facilitators The actual users that are welcome in the space. The actual degree of facilitation required for the activities conducted in/by the lab Enabling teamwork The actual role of the space in enabling physical and virtual teamwork Actual events The type of events that actually take place in the lab Referring to innovation labs, it is naturally expected that their activity will result in some kind of innovation output. However, due to their intermediate nature, their results are not always easy to recognize or value. Beyond this, it is clear that the activity of innovation labs triggers a set of creative and innovation processes involving the community that ultimately lead to positive testimonials and compelling stories. Therefore, when referring to the outcomes of an innovation lab one should consider both its tangible and intangible results that are duplicable, new and useful in its context (Osorio et al. 2019; Moultrie et al. 2007). Outcomes - Guiding set of criteria for Innovation Labs Criteria Tangible results Intangible results Realization of strategic intent 4.2.2 The Green FabLab Project - Fabio Cruz Fabio Cruz, research associate at the University of Lorraine presents the case of Green FabLab, a research project dedicated to the creation of a local and open source plastic recycling process for a circular economy. To know more about this project you can have a look to the paper (Roux-Marchand et al. 2020). 4.2.3 LabCidades: The Community Garden - Rafael Camargo &amp; André Turbay The Community Garden brought together several actors from the neighborhood that includes PUCPR. From the dream of a resident of the neighborhood, to transform an area that served as a waste deposit into a space that would contribute to the community. As a result of this initiative, several actors were connected, such as a local daycare center, collectors of recyclables, and the PUCPR itself, through LabCidades and the Curos de Agronomia. This video explains how this transformation took place. 4.3 Case Experience 4.3.1 Université de Lorraine  Mauricio Camargo Professor Mauricio Camargo, Director of the Research Institute for Research in Innovation Processes - ERPI and Professor at the School of Innovation - ENSGSI explains the role of the Lorraine Fab Living Lab - LF2L at the Université de Lorraine. 4.4 Team Workshop 5 - Pitch your Climate Lab! The purpose of this workshop is for you to round-up the strategic design of your Climate Lab and be ready to communicate your intent to your partners and stakeholders. Therefore, the main task for you during this fourth sprint is to prepare a pitch to present your Climate Lab in 3 minutes. The following are the main steps that we are going to follow: Prepare your pitch! Round-up the strategic design of your Climate Labs. This means that you should have finished all the precedents workshops so you can have all the insights to feed your pitch. Based on all the previous work, collectively identify your value, your ambition, your strengths and your expected tangible and intangible results (environmental impact, social impact). Any pitch must be tailored to the audience. Identify what emotions you want to generate: (i) create a connection with your audience to establish shared values or build communion, (ii) foster collaboration by getting the audience to take action or side with you, or (iii) generate awareness through education and be informative. Lets test your pitch! During the mentoring session (August 27) each one of the CLT will present their Climate Lab to all members of consortium. You will receive feedback from mentors and all the Climate Lab community. Present your pitch to the Climate Lab External Committee! Reflect on the feedback received from your peers and adjust your pitch A special event is being prepared for the opening of Sprint 5 (September 03) where all CLT are invited to present their Climate Lab in 3 minutes to the External Committee. Be ready! Here we share with you some tips for making an impactful pitch: Identify what type of pitch you want to use. You can mix types, but be as clear as possible. Tweet Pitch: respond to the questions: What? How? Why? answer a question: what does the Climate Lab do? Pitch to investors: have a structure with key elements, why they are going to leave their money in your lab. Pitch to partners: present the purpose of your lab, show what are the advantages of collaborating with your lab. Ask all team members why they want to work on this climate lab project. Sales pitch: convince your potential clients to trust in your lab initiative, to participate in it. Present how your Climate Lab will be useful in their life. Find 10 words that best represent your Climate Lab. Choose 10 words that you think are the most meaningful to share about your lab.
