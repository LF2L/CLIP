[["index.html", "Climate Labs Incubation Program 2021 Welcome to CLIP", " Climate Labs Incubation Program 2021 Université de Lorraine1, PUCPR2 2021-04-16 Welcome to CLIP The Université de Lorraine and the Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná have led the design of the Climate Lab Incubation Program (CLIP). This program is intended to be a virtual space for sharing knowledge and experiences from the members of the Climate Lab consortium. The CLIP will serve as guidance and inspiration in the path of implementing the network of Climate Labs in Latin-American universities. The objective of this incubation program is to enable the Climate Lab Teams (CLT) to move forward in the design and implementation of their social innovation platform. Therefore, it is expected that all members of the CLT participate actively throughout the ensemble of the program. Welcome to the first version of CLIP and please enjoy the design of your Climate Lab https://erpi.univ-lorraine.fr/ https://www.pucpr.br/ "],["program-description.html", "Program Description Methodology Key Action Moments Successful completion of the program Operation and online platforms", " Program Description Methodology The CLIP has a duration of six months starting from April 9 until October 15. The incubation program is structured in six sprints in which participants are introduced to a set of conceptual material together with specific strategic workshops. Each sprint has specific goals that the CLT should fulfill in order to successfully complete the program. The results of each sprint are to be uploaded to the website assigned to each team. The website will serve as a prototype for the strategic design of the Climate Lab that the CLT can ultimately use to validate their proposals with other stakeholders, and as a dissemination tool for their local Climate Lab initiative. The incubation program is conceived as a collective pool of knowledge and therefore brings together various methods, practices and tools shared by consortium members and invited experts. All the different experiences are articulated under the innovation lab framework that has been developed by the ERPI of Université de Lorraine as part of its research strand in fostering collaborative innovation processes (Osorio et al. 2019). Building on the context analysis and capability mapping started in WP2.1., this incubation program proposes to the CLT to proactively and collectively strategize in terms of the main innovation lab components as shown in the figure below. Key Action Moments There are five key action moments throughout the CLIP: Sprint opening (1h30 per sprint) Synchronous webinar via Zoom in which sprint goals and main activities are presented to CLT Online material (Between 1h and 1h30 of video content per sprint) CLT can access the online material via the CLIP website. Content is composed by conceptual videos, case experiences and complimentary readings Members of CLT should access this content prior conducting each workshop Team workshops (Between 1h30 and 2h per workshop) Each sprint proposes to the CLT a strategic workshop that should be conducted as a team Workshops templates are provided via the Mural platform Tutorships (1h per sprint) Intermediary check-ins via Zoom are proposed to the CLT in the forms of Q&amp;A sessions This is the moment for CLT to exchange with their mentors and guest experts to share their experiences or ask questions regarding the ongoing sprints goal. Upload and share sprint results By the end of each sprint, the CLT should upload their workshop results to their Climate Lab website prototype At the beginning of the next sprint, the CLT will briefly present to the consortium their results and learnings Participants from each CLT are expected to dedicate 2 hours minimum per week to the CLIP. Successful completion of the program To successfully complete the incubation program, the CLT need to: Conduct as a team each one of the workshops that will be assigned in each sprint. Upload the workshop results to a non-published website that will constitute the prototype for the strategic design of their ClimateLab. Share progress at the beginning of each sprint. Final presentation of the strategic design of the Climate Lab at the mid-project meeting. Operation and online platforms All the incubation program content will be available through the CLIP Website: &lt;https://lf2l.fr/CLIP/&gt; Webinars and video calls will be held through Zoom. Workshop templates will be available via MURAL. Website prototype templates will be provided via Google Sites.

Here we are going to focus con the Fundamentals and Principles for the Climate Labs. The main goal in this sprint is to build your Climate Lab Manifesto Sprint dates: From April 9 to April 29 A webinar will be held on April 9 to officially launch the incubation program. It will be a synchronous session, so all CLT are expected to attend. In addition, a series of contents and activities are proposed to the CLT to be completed during the sprint: Firstly, you will find three conceptual videos which are proposed to open the discussion on the three thematic pillars that constitute the Climate Lab project: Climate Change, Social Innovation and Innovation Labs. Secondly, two case experiences from members of the consortium are shared. This way we can learn a little more about the experience of each of the CLT. Next, you will find the link to the team workshop of this sprint. The workshop should be completed before the end of the sprint (April 29). And finally, complementary readings are offered for those who would like to further explore the topics addressed in this sprint. The full recording of the webinar can be watched below. Alternatively, you can access the slides from the webinar here. 1.2 Conceptual Videos 1.2.1 Climate change and social challenges - Paola Alfaro dAlençon &amp; Harry Bollmann Professors Paola Alfaro dAlençon from TU Berlin and Università di Genova, and Harry Bollman from Universidade Católica do Paraná have prepared a conversation around the mains aspects of climate change. Based on their experiences at their universities and the projects they have been involved in, Paola and Harry discuss climate change through different facets such as climate injustice, social infrastructure, governance and community. This video was edited with the best moments from the complete conversation, which can be accessed here. 1.2.2 What is Social Innovation? - Gabriela Carrasco Gabriela Carrasco from Ashoka and 2811 shares an introduction to social innovation and entrepreneurship. 1.2.3 Innovation Spaces - Laure Morel Professor Laure Morel from Université de Lorraine introduces the notion of innovation spaces and how these collaborative structures can play a major role in fostering social innovation for climate change. This presentation is based on her book chapter Innovation spaces: new places for collective intelligence? (Morel, Dupont, and Boudarel 2018). 1.3 Case Experiences 1.3.1 Universitat Politècnica de València Professor Carola Calabuig shares her experience and vision on social innovation at the INGENIO Research Institute of the Universitat Politècnica de València. She emphasizes the importance of the collective and grassroots dimension of innovation processes that happen outside the dominant or traditional spaces of knowledge generation. 1.3.2 Universidad de Guadalajara Professor Javier Garcia of the Universidad de Guadalajara gives an overview of the project Carbon footprint measurement for the generation of sustainable strategies in avocado crops. 1.4 Team Workshop 1 Here you can find for each University the link to the sprint 1 workshop: Colombia Universidad de Caldas Universidad del Quindio Universidad de Manizales Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira Corporacion Universitaria Minuto de Dios Mexico Instituto Tecnológico y Estudios Superiores de Monterrey Universidad de Guadalajara Brazil Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul Pontifícia Universidade Católica Do Paraná Universidade Católica de Pernambuco 1.5 Let us know your comments In this section, you can put any comments/questions or share your thoughts and feedback about this sprint.
