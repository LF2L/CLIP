**GOAL**

The goal of sprint V is:

> To set-up the local Climate Lab pilot project moving from the strategic to the operational level.
>
> *Sprint dates: **From September 24 to October 15 / 2021***
:::

In this sprint the Climate Lab Teams will focus their efforts on the set-up of their pilot project. In this case leaders from the Work Package 2.4 join us to provide the introduce the methodology that will guide the pilot project implementation. Specifically for this sprint, the teams are invited to assess their territory and community.

1.  For this sprint **the last two conceptual videos** share insights on the application of the living lab approach. This approach/methodology is considered suitable to the pilot projects.

2.  Then, the final **team workshop** is proposed by the colleagues from Work Package 2.4 during the opening webinar.
